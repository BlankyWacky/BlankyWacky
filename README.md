# Hi, I'm Blink1000/BlankyWacky 👋

I'm a Rust and Java fullstack developer specializing in **reverse engineering** and **low-level system interactions**. I enjoy peering under the hood of complex software, especially video games, to understand how they work and build high-performance tools.

### 🔧 What I Do

- 🦀 **Rust Development**: Architecting robust, memory-safe tools for high-performance applications.
- 🔬 **Reverse Engineering**: Deconstructing game logic and network protocols to build custom utilities.
- 💻 **Memory Hacking**: Crafting external tools that interact with process memory for automation and analysis. My work includes projects built with Direct Memory Access (DMA) for maximum performance and stealth.
- 🎮 **Game Modding**: Currently developing tools and accessories for games like Overwatch 2.
