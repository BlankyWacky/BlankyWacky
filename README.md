# Hi, I'm Blink1000/BlankyWacky üëã

I'm a Rust and Java **Systems Developer** specializing in **reverse engineering**, **low-level system interactions**, and **complex client-server architecture**. I enjoy peering under the hood of complex software to understand how it works and build high-performance tools.

### üîß What I Do

- ü¶Ä **Rust & Java Development**: Architecting robust, memory-safe tools for high-performance applications.
- üíª **Low-Level Systems**: Building tools that interact directly with memory, hardware, and virtual machines using crates like `memflow` and advanced techniques like signature scanning.
- üåê **Client-Server Architecture**: Designing and implementing custom TCP/UDP protocols to create powerful, distributed systems.
- üî¨ **Reverse Engineering**: Deconstructing game logic, SDKs, and network APIs to enable custom functionality.

### üöÄ Featured Projects & Experience

My practical experience comes from a deep portfolio of personal projects. Here are a few highlights:

- **`Remote VM Memory Analysis Framework (Rust)`**
  - **Description**: A sophisticated client-server system where a server on a host machine uses the `memflow` crate to read memory from a guest virtual machine. A client inside the VM sends commands over TCP/UDP to the server to request memory reads/memory writes, send keyboard inputs back to the VM.
  - **Skills Demonstrated**: Advanced Rust, **Client-Server Architecture**, Networking (**TCP/UDP**), Virtualization, **`memflow`**, and designing custom communication protocols.

- **`External Memory Tools (Minecraft & others)`**
  - **Description**: An external memory hacking tool for Minecraft designed to be version-independent.
  - **Skills Demonstrated**: Advanced memory manipulation, **signature scanning (AOB scanning)** to dynamically locate memory offsets, Windows API, and designing resilient, update-proof systems.

- **`Custom 2D Java Game Engine & Platformer (Java)`**
  - **Description**: A from-scratch 2D game engine built in Java, which powers a complete platformer game. Notably, this includes a **custom-built GUI framework** with its own components (buttons, sliders) built on top of JFrame.
  - **Skills Demonstrated**: Strong object-oriented design, game loop architecture, rendering pipelines, collision detection, and a deep understanding of UI/event handling.

- **`Unreal Engine SDK Parser (Rust)`**
  - **Description**: A high-performance Rust tool that parses Unreal Engine SDK files into a human-readable text format.
  - **Skills Demonstrated**: Efficient file I/O and binary parsing in Rust, data structure manipulation, and creating automation tools for game modding workflows.

### üí° Additional Experience Includes

- **Internal Game Clients**: Developed a comprehensive modified client for Minecraft, demonstrating end-to-end tool creation:
  - **Custom GUI Framework**: Built a complete user interface from scratch using JFrame, including custom components for controlling the client's features.
  - **Module Development**: Implemented various modules to hook into and modify core game logic.
  - **Advanced Rendering**: Integrated rendering utilities to display custom information and visuals within the game world (e.g., World-to-Screen transformations).
- **Hardware ID Systems**: Built systems for both checking and generating hardware-specific identifiers (HWIDs).
- **Network Lag Switch**: Created a utility to intercept and control TCP/UDP packets to simulate high-latency network conditions.
